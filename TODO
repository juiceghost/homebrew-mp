Minimum Profit TODO
===================

Bugs
----

 * Word wrap seems to be broken in some special cases.
 * The usage() function should be platform-dependent and show
   only usable command-line arguments (now it's a mess).
 * The win32 version should have history in its readline.
 * Autoindent doesn't work when word wrap is active.

GTK 2.0
~~~~~~~

Is everything working yet?

Enhancements
------------

 * Create a new synhi for diff files.
 * New window pos / size must be logged in GTK.
 * Create a man page. It should contain, at least, the editor functions
   and the configuration file commands.
 * By using the tags, each time the cursor is over one, the tag target
   should be shown in the status line, allowing the function prototypes
   to be immediately seen.
 * Take a look at the elinks source to see how wheel-mouse can be
   used in rxvt and xterm.
 * The tag list should be browseable, as well as the list selection
   file in the curses version.
 * Tags, files to be open, templates and such things should be shown
   in something like Mozilla's sidebar or so.
 * Documentation. Lots of documentation.

Config.sh-detectable cases
--------------------------

 * -lcurses or -lncurses.
 * Curses use_default_colors(). Still necessary?
 * gtk2 or gtk1.
 * GLOB.
 * working popen?
 * --without-synhi, --without-i18n
 * The damn regex thing. System regex? compile gnu_regex.c?

Global defaults that can be written to config.h
-----------------------------------------------

 * DEFAULT_TAB_SIZE
 * MAX_MACRO_SIZE
 * AUTO_INDENT
 * CONFIG_FILE_NAME
 * MAX_WORDS_PER_SYNHI
 * MAX_LOCAL_TOKENS
