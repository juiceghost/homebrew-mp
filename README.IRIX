README.IRIX
===========

To compile Minimum Profit under IRIX you need both GNU make and GCC, so
you need to run

	$ gmake CC=gcc CURSES=curses

to build it (it probably can also be compiled with SGI's native C compiler,
but I don't own a CC license on my O2 to test it). You can obtain both GNU
Make and GCC from http://freeware.sgi.com.
